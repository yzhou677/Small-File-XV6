Small file test:
file_test creates a small file, writes data less than 64 bytes, and then reads the small file. 

Normal file test:
file_test1 creates a normal file, writes something into it and then reads the normal file.

Error test:
file_test2 creats a small file, but tries to write data that is bigger than 64 bytes.

file_test3
read data bytes is bigger than the actual file data size, return the actual size of file data 


The above four tests include small file test, normal file test, error test and read with bigger size test. 
They cover every situation, so they are good tests.
